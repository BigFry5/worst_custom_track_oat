detail poo track ftw





The main challenge was trying to filter the tracks such that the results weren't just tracks with long names. I originally started with 2 scores, the length score and non-alpha score, since I believed having a lot of non alpha characters generally makes the track weirder / worse (I made sure spaces weren't counted btw). This lead to the list being entirely tracks w long names, which wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, so I added a length penalty to give smaller track names a boost. Furthermore, the non-alpha score and penalties were tuned to my own discretion, which is why they're kinda random. I just played around with them until I got a good mix of tracks with loing names and short names, since I figured it would be the most entertaining.
